# Cs207 Alarm Clock
An Arduino supported clock with the added feature of an alarm.

This repository will be going through on everything you need to replicate the alarm clock build that I have added on from the original creator of just a binary clock Lagsilva (1). Alongside the alarm is not just a normal buzzer, it plays the tetris theme at an increased tempo which orginialy was aquired from lukecyca on Github (2).

This clock makes use of a Tiny I2C RTC Module and a Maxim Max 7219 Led Matrix. It was made with the idea of wanting a catchier alarm and to avoid using ones phone as it could then persuade someone to play on there phone over sleeping. The rest of this will have build materials the schematics of the build and the use of the Alarm clock.
